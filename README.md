# Limited Resources Teaching R Programming at the University of Houston-Downtown

### A brief introduction

This project presented the research that confirm a lack of learning resources for R (programming language) and gave a recommendation to solve this issue. Its goal is to help the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Houston-Downtown retain, attract, and help students in learning R. The project includes results of a student survey, interviews with professors, and multiple comparison analyses. The most appropriate and immediate recommendation is the creation of a reference guide that includes all necessary codes and their functions.
